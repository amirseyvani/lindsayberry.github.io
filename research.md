I have broad research interests in Bayesian statistics.  My current research touches upon topics including forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!  Below are some of the projects I'm currently involved in. 

#### Demand Forecasting for High Dimensional Time Series of Counts
As a research assistant for 84.51, I am interesting in forecasting demand for products with low volume daily sales counts. This project involves developing sequential, on-line forecasting models for low volume count data. 

#### Obscenity cases over time
Interdisciplinary research analyzing the number of obscenity cases over time and space, and the relationship to factors like obscenity-related Supreme Court cases, and presidential party. 

#### [Co-Curricular Technology Pathways e-advisor](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/co-curricular-technology-pathways-e-advisor)
I will serve as the project manager for a group of Duke undergrads participating in [Data+](https://bigdata.duke.edu/data).
