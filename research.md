I have broad research interests in Bayesian statistics.  My current research touches upon topics including forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!  Below are some of the projects I'm currently involved in.

#### Demand Forecasting for High Dimensional Time Series of Counts
As a research assistant for 84.51&deg;, I am interesting in forecasting demand for products with low volume daily sales counts. This project involves developing sequential, on-line forecasting models for low volume count data.  

[Bayesian forecasting of many count-valued time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05232)  
[Probabilistic forecasting of heterogeneous consumer transaction-sales time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04698)  

#### [Co-Curricular Technology Pathways e-advisor](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/co-curricular-technology-pathways-e-advisor)
I served as the project manager for a group of Duke undergrads participating in [Data+](https://bigdata.duke.edu/data) during the summer of 2018.
