My name is Lindsay Berry and I'm a third year PhD student in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. I'm advised my [Dr. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/), and we are currently working on projects related to Bayesian forecasting and time series models. 

If you'd like to get in contact with me, feel free to [send me an email.](mailto:lindsay.berry@duke.edu)
