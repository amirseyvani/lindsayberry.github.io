I have broad research interests in applied Bayesian analysis.  Below are some of the projects I'm currently involved in. 

### Demand Forecasting for High Dimensional Time Series of Counts
As a research assistant for 84.51, I am interesting in forecasting demand for products with low volume daily sales counts. This project involves developing sequential, on-line forecasting models for low volume count data. 

### Simulation Control of Adaptive Clinical Trials
In this project, I studied how simulation could be used in the analysis of adaptive clinical trials. Specifically, I was interested in seamless phase II/III trials, and I showed that simulation could lead to higher power and larger phase II trials than in traditional separate trials.
