I'm a third year PhD candidate in [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). I work with [Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [84.51](https://www.8451.com/) on large scale Bayesian forecasting in the context of product demand forecasting. My current research touches upon topics including forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!

From 2011 to 2015, I attended the University of Texas at Austin (:metal:), where I received my BS in Mathematics and was a member of the Dean's Scholars.

Outside of statistics, I enjoy reading, yoga, hiking, Duke basketball, adventuring with my dog Maverick, and [biking for good causes](https://bikeandbuild.org/).

If you have any other questions, feel free to [send me an email.](mailto:lindsay.berry@duke.edu)
