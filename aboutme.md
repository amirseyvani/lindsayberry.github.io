title: About Me
---

I'm a third year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/), and we're currently working with [84.51](https://www.8451.com/) on projects related to Bayesian forecasting and time series models.

Before coming to Duke, I attended the University of Texas at Austin (:metal:), where I received my BS in Mathematics and was a member of the Dean's Scholars.

If you have any other questions, feel free to [send me an email.](mailto:lindsay.berry@duke.edu)
